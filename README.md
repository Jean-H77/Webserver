# Java HTTP Server

This project aims to explore the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol and server-side programming using Java. By implementing an HTTP server from scratch, you will gain insights into how web servers handle client requests, process HTTP methods (such as GET and POST), manage connections, and serve static/dynamic content.




## Roadmap

- [x]  Research HTTP specifications and server architecture.
- [x]  Implement basic server initialization.
- [x]  Develop request handling logic.
- [x]  GET Requests
   - [x]  Serve static html files
   - [x]  Send POJOs as JSON
